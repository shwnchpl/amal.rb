amal.rb example
---------------

The file ``sample-amalgam.c`` in this directory was generated by running
the following command from this directory::

    $ amal.rb --headers ./include --src ./src > ./sample-amalgam.c

This file can be built using your favorite compiler as follows::

    $ cc ./sample-amalgam.c -o ./sample.amalgam

Alternatively, the files in this directory can be built in
non-amalgamated form as follows::

    $ cc -I./include/ ./src/foo.c ./src/bar.c ./src/main.c \
        ./src/bas/bas.c -o ./sample.separate

The output from these two commands should be relatively similar.

If ``cc`` happens to actually invoke your favorite compiler, the
provided ``build.sh`` script may be handy.
